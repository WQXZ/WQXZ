A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ ⓘ WI-kee) is a form of hypertext publication on the internet 
which is collaboratively edited and managed by its audience directly through a web browser. 
A typical wiki contains multiple pages that can either
 be edited by the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.
